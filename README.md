# graficky

Querying and working with Graphite can be messy. Graficky will be a Python
library to interface with the Graphite web API to easily create metrics, query
them, and apply Graphite built-in functions to them.

This project is still under development and hasn't been released yet.

The API that this uses for communicating with Graphite is the latest version of
the API as specified in (readthedocs)[https://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/]
on 5/15/2015.
